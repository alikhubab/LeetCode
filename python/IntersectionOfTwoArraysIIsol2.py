# Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their
# intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both
# arrays and you may return the result in any order.
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
# Output: [2,2]
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
# Output: [4,9]
# Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
#  0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
#
#
#
#  Follow up:
#
#
#  What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your
# algorithm?
#  What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is
# better?
#  What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such
# that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
